                <p>George has called Galiano home for 36 years. He and his wife Karen
                have raised 5 children here, the youngest of whom graduated in June
                as valedictorian.  A keen member of our business community since 1983,
                George has created employment for islanders. He has also played a role
                in numerous campaigns to protect our precious natural abundance.
                His experience with supporting both of these – a healthy economy and
                a community of passionate protectors of our ecology – motivated him to
                run in the last election; to earn the opportunity to work with and serve
                the island in this capacity.</p>
                <p>Four years later, he remains as committed as ever to his mission
                of responding to our community's needs while honouring what is,
                now more than ever, a critical mandate to preserve and protect our
                island's natural beauty. In his four years as our trustee, he has
                learned a tremendous amount about land use planning, water preservation
                and how to mobilize bureaucratic structures to achieve our collective
                vision and goals. He will continue learning to be an ever more effective trustee
                and to use his diverse experiences and creative problem-solving skills to
                continue addressing challenges like affordable housing, year-round economic
                initiatives and opening the east coast access road for emergency use.
                George's promise is to continue listening to us, all of us, as we navigate together
                to build a balance between providing our community members with basic
                needs and services, and preserving this precious piece of land we are
                blessed to call home.</p>

                    <p>The late 80's and early 90's were a heyday for public action to protect Galiano's forests. A communal
                    energy to save our precious landmarks like Mount Galiano and Bodega Ridge swept through the school,
                    community halls, stores and dinner tables.</p>
                    <p>So when my dad, brothers and I heard about what was happening at Clayoquot Sound we wanted
                    to participate. We were at our Cameron Lane home, soaking up the early summer sun surrounded by
                    evergreens when a story came on the radio about the protests against MacBlos clearcut campaign. We
                    looked at one another with knowing eyes and barely spoke. We knew we had to go. Within minutes, our
                    white Toyota Tercel was packed for camping and we rushed down island to catch the next ferry. We
                    popped into my mom's house to tell her we were going camping. We didn't have time to explain the
                    details.</p>
                    <p>We crossed Vancouver Island and pulled up at dusk to the protest camp near Kennedy Lake. It
                    was small and intimate, hardly more than a dozen tents scattered about, a far cry from the thousands of us
                    who celebrated our strength with a Midnight Oil concert at the height of the protests. We awoke before
                    dawn and gathered around a small fire, ate oatmeal and drank hot chocolate while a wild-haired young
                    woman named Tzeporah spoke with clear and calm passion about the protocol for the morning
                    demonstrations and shared details about the court injunction that restricted any of us from standing on the
                    bridge.</p>
                    <p>We gathered in a circle before Kennedy Lake Bridge and sang a chant whose words and beat
                    give me shivers 25 years later: “Standing on the bridge in the morning dawn.” The details are fuzzy but I
                    remember Tyson and me consulting after we'd learned that nobody would be getting arrested that day. We
                    told Tzeporah, quite assuredly, that we were going to stand in front of the logging trucks. She said we'd
                    have to convince our dad to come with us. Getting arrested hadn't been part of our plan and Dad knew
                    there would be repercussions but in the end his heart beat his mind and the three of us, 10-year-old Tyson,
                    our dad and I held hands and walked to the bridge and stood smiling and with the feeling of each other's
                    hands warming our own. From the other side of the road came hostile shouts from the loggers' families,
                    their faces contorted as they threw nasty insults at my dad. The three of us continued holding hands as the
                    RCMP cuffed my dad and led us to their police cruiser.</p>
                    <p>The CBC got wind of our story and one reporter was particularly drawn to the part about us
                    being without our mom. So they cold-called mom back on Galiano and asked her if she knew where her
                    children were. She said, “Yes, they're on a camping trip with their dad.” The way my mom tells it there
                    was a pause on the other line as the reporter licked his lips before delivering what he thought was going to
                    lead to a bit of reality radio. “Oh,” he continued, “well, do I have news for you. Your ex-husband and
                    your children have been arrested.”</p>
                    <p>The reporter explained the situation and my mom said something along the line of, “Oh, how
                    wonderful!” And then she told him about how Galiano's recent efforts meant that, though we were young,
                    we had a deep connection and understanding about the need to protect our forests and that she trusted and
                    supported her ex-husband, my dad.</p>
                    <p>Another story quoted my brother Simon, then 7 years old, as saying that he didn't get arrested
                    with us because he had heard that the food you got in jail was pretty bad.</p>
                    <p>My dad was sentenced to one month in jail. He took it in stride and with good spirits and with
                    ample support from his Galiano community.</p>

                <p>I am not sure if you are going to run for the Trust
                again. I would be happy if you did as you bring a
                level of civility that has been sorely missed in
                those meetings. You stand up for what is good for
                the island both human and non-human in a way
